I've been taking my usual medication for my hypertension, but I'm not sure if this is related. Lately, I've been working long hours with poor lighting in my office, and I can't help but think that might be a factor. I've also been feeling really tired and stressed out lately, and this headache is just the cherry on top. I'm just hoping you can help me figure out what's going on and get some relief from this awful pain.\"",
